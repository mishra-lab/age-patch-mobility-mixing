# Age Patch Mobility Mixing
Deriving contact patterns for age & patch mixing, based on recurrent mobility data, using:
1. Canadian contact projections from POLYMOD (Prem 2021)
2. Ontario mobility data from Veraset (Ghasemi 2021)
3. Patch-based mixing methods from (Arenas 2020)

## Private Data
This project uses a few private datasets, masked from the repo via .gitignore.
Please contact us for any questions or clarifications about these data.
