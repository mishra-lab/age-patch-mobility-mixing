\textbf{How does each assumption below influence patch/age contact patterns?}%
\bigskip\par
Overall assumption in \cite{Arenas2020}:
\textit{fixed age pattern for all patches \& contact types}\par
\indent 3 component \textbf{assumptions}:\par
\begin{assumptions}
  \item \textit{Contact patterns are equal (averaged) across contact types}
  \item \textit{Contact patterns are not adjusted to per-patch age distributions}
  \item \textit{Contacts at ``home'' include visitors to the patch}
\end{assumptions}
