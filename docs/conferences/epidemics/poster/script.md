Hello, and thanks for checking out my poster.

Like many infectious diseases, dynamics of COVID-19 transmission are mediated by contact patterns,
especially between different age groups, and geographic patches.
Prem et al project contact patterns by age observed in the POLYMOD study onto 177 countries.
Arenas et al develop a model of contact patterns by geographic patches associated with "recurrent mobility",
such as travelling for work or school.
We integrated these two approaches to define data-driven contact patterns,
stratified by both age and geographic patches.

In doing so, we identified three assumptions made in the Arenas model that are no longer required in our approach;
namely:
1. that age contact patterns are the same for all contact types;
2. that contact patterns are not adjusted to the local patch age distribution; and
3. that "home" contacts can be formed with visitors to the patch.
We sought to examine how these three assumptions influenced the estimated age and patch contact patterns.

We applied our approach to 10 geographic patches in Ontario Canada, using mobility data from April 2020.
We estimated daily contacts per person, stratified by age, patch, and contact type, with and without each assumption,
and compared the resulting patterns.

We found:
1. that fixing age contact patterns for all contact types
may underestimate inter-generational contacts at home during periods of reduced mobility;
2. that not adjusting contact patterns to local age demographics
can underestimate contacts with larger age groups, and overestimate contacts with smaller age groups;
3. and that geographic patches may be more disconnected than expected due to
the predominance of within-patch mobility, and home contacts during periods of reduced mobility.

These findings may be relevant to model-based evaluation of
patch and/or age-targeted interventions for infectious diseases, like COVID-19.

More details about our approach are available in pre-print,
and all analysis code is available on GitHub at the link given in the poster.

Thanks for listening!
