Hello, thanks for checking out my poster called,
# Contact patterns by age and geography with recurrent mobility: influence of relaxing assumptions

Contact patterns, such as by age and geographic patches, mediate infectious disease dynamics.
Prem et al project contact patterns by age observed in the POLYMOD study onto 177 countries.
Arenas et al develop a model of contact patterns by geographic patches associated with recurrent mobility,
such as travelling for work or school.
We integrated these two approaches to define data-driven contact patterns,
stratified by both age and geographic patches.

In doing so, we identified three assumptions made in the Arenas model that are no longer required in our approach;
namely:
1. that age contact patterns are the same for all contact types;
2. that contact patterns are not adjusted to the local age distribution; and
3. that "home" contacts can be formed with visitors to the patch.
We sought to examine how these three assumptions influenced the estimated age and patch contact patterns.

We applied our approach to 10 geographic patches in Ontario Canada, using mobility data from April 2020.
We estimated daily contacts per person, stratified by age, patch, and contact type, with and without each assumption,
and compared the resulting contact patterns.

We found:
1. that fixing age contact patterns for all contact types
may underestimate inter-generational contacts at home during periods of reduced mobility;
2. that not adjusting age contact patterns to local age demographics
may over- or underestimate contact rates in different patches;
3. and that geographic patches may be more disconnected than expected due to
the predominance of home contacts, and within-patch mobility.

These findings may be relevant to model-based evaluation of patch or age-targeted interventions for infectious diseases.
