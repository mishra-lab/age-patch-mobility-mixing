We \textbf{estimated \& compared} $C_{gag'a'y}$: \# daily type-$y$ contacts per-person from patch/age $ga$ to $g'a'$\\
under different combinations of assumptions, to infer the effect of each assumption:
\bigskip\par
\begin{tabular}{crcll}
  \textbullet & (1+2+3) & vs & (2+3)     & $\rightarrow$ assumption 1 effect \\
  \textbullet &   (2+3) & vs & (3)       & $\rightarrow$ assumption 2 effect \\
  \textbullet &     (3) & vs & ($\cdot$) & $\rightarrow$ assumption 3 effect
\end{tabular}
\bigskip\par
We aggregated $C_{gag'a'y}$ across patches/ages to show overall patterns by age $aa'$ or patch $gg'$
