\begin{itemize}
  \item Fixing age patterns for all patches \& contact types
        \textbf{may underestimate intergenerational home contacts} during reduced mobility
  \item Not adjusting contact patterns to per-patch age distributions
        \textbf{may over/underestimate overall contacts in different patches}
  \item Predominance of home contacts \& within-patch mobility may result in
        \textbf{relatively few contacts between patches}
  \item Assumptions about contact patterns may influence
        model-based evaluations of \textbf{patch/age-targeted interventions} for infectious diseases
  \item Our approach to estimate contact patterns \textbf{integrates empiric contact patterns and mobility data},
        and thus reduces the required assumptions
