\begin{itemize}
  \item Contact patterns mediate dynamics of infectious diseases\par
        e.g. in transmission models stratified by \textbf{age} \& geographic \textbf{patches} \cite{Mishra2021}
  \item \citet{Prem2021} project age contact patterns onto 177 countries:\par
        ``home'', ``work'', ``school'', \& ``other'' contacts from \textbf{\textsc{polymod}}
  \item \citet{Arenas2020} model patch/age contacts due to recurrent \textbf{mobility}:\par
        repeated daily travel between patches
  \item We built-upon \cite{Arenas2020} to integrate age contact patterns from \cite{Prem2021},\par
        and relax 3 assumptions made in \cite{Arenas2020} ---
        details in of our approach in \cite{Knight2021}
  \item We explored the effect of each assumption on modelled contact patterns\par
        in the context of \textbf{reduced mobility} (April 2020)
\end{itemize}
