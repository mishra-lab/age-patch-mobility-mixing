\begin{assumptions}
  \item If contact patterns averaged across types (Figure~\ref{fig:panel-diff}.i)
        \par$\rightarrow$ overestimate like-with-like age patterns from school/work
        \par$\rightarrow$ underestimate inter-generational contacts from home
  \item If contact patterns not locally age-adjusted (Figure~\ref{fig:panel-diff}.ii)
        \par$\rightarrow$ overestimate contacts with smaller age groups
        \par$\rightarrow$ underestimate contacts with larger age groups
  \item If contacts at home can include patch visitors (Figure~\ref{fig:panel-diff}.iii)
        \par$\rightarrow$ overestimate contacts formed with other patches
        \par$\rightarrow$ underestimate contacts formed within same patch
