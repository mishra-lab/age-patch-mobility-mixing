  JK conceived of and developed the approach, reviewed the literature, conducted the mixing analyses, and wrote the code and manuscript.
  AG conducted and led data analyses and developed the mobility metrics.
  HM provided critical input into the assumptions and bias adjustments with the mobility data.
  MH, KB, and SM contributed critical insights to the assumpitons, data, approach, and interpretation.
  All authors were involved in intepretation and manuscript revisions.
