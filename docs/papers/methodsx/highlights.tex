\begin{itemize}
  \item Our approach includes a distribution of contacts by age
        that is responsive to the underlying age distributions of the mixing populations.
  \item Our approach maintains different age mixing patterns by contact type,
        such that changes to the numbers of different types of contacts
        are appropriately reflected in changes to overall age mixing patterns.
  \item Our approach distinguishes between two mixing pools associated with each patch,
        with possible implications for the overall connectivity of the population:
        the home pool, in which contacts can only be formed with other individuals residing in the same patch,
        and the travel pool, in which contacts can be formed with some residents of, and any other visitors to the patch.
