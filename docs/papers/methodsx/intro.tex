\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
Contact patterns are key determinants of epidemic dynamics
because they define who can be infected, by whom, and how quickly \cite{Mossong2008}.
\citet{Arenas2020} develop a patch-based model of \sarscovii transmission applied to Spain,
in which the modelled population is stratified by geographic patches and three age groups.
Following foundational work by \citet{Balcan2011,Sattenspiel1995},
the model incorporates data on short, recurrent mobility patterns
to determine contact rates between individuals in different patches and age groups.
We build upon this contact model to incorporate improved age mixing patterns,
which are stratified by different contact types and are responsive to
the age distributions of mixing populations, as proposed by \citet{Arregui2018}.
We also explore some practical considerations in parameterizing such models.
