\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
Contact patterns are key determinants of epidemic dynamics.
\citet{Arenas2020} develop a patch-based model of \covid transmission applied to Spain,
in which the modelled population is stratified by geographic patches and three age groups.
Following foundational work by \citet{Balcan2011,Sattenspiel1995},
the model incorporates data on short, recurrent mobility patterns
to determine contact rates between individuals in different patches and age groups.
We build upon this contact model to incorporate age mixing patterns
for different contact types which are responsive to
the age distributions of mixing populations, as proposed by \citet{Arregui2018}.
% MH: Again - believe this should be at the beginning of the sentence.
% JK: But Arregui2018 didn't propose to "build upon this model" since it was published prior.
% hopefully it still reads okay like this?
We also explore some practical challenges in parameterizing such models.
