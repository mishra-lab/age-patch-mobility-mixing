\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
Contact patterns are key determinants of epidemic dynamics.
\citet{Arenas2020} develop a patch-based model of \covid transmission applied to Spain,
in which the modelled population is stratified by geographic patches and three age groups.
The model incorporates data on short, recurrent mobility patterns
to determine contact rates between individuals in different patches and age groups,
following foundational work by \citet{Balcan2011,Sattenspiel1995}.
% MH: To read correctly, this should be at the beginning of sentence
%     ... i.e.  "Following foundational work ... the model incorporates data on ..."
We build upon this contact model to incorporate age mixing patterns
for different contact types which are responsive to
the age distributions of mixing populations, as proposed by \citet{Arregui2018}.
% MH: Again - believe this should be at the beginning of the sentence.
We also explore some practical challenges in parameterizing such models.
