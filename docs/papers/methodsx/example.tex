\section{Example}\label{ex}
% SM: include mention of ethics review/REB approval here from UofT (similar to the serial interval paper).
% JK: I added in the acknowledgements in meta.tex (same as serial interval paper)
%     but let me know if it should be here instead?
% HM: We describe all ON specific data here? For others want to implement the method,
%     they will need to change data section to their context? so polymond Canada data will be here too?
% JK: Yes, that's right -- basically they can plop in their own methods / data to obtain
%     the four parameters required for our mixing approach,
%     those 4 parameters that are listed at the end of section 3.1: Pga, Caa'y, Bgg', hy.
We applied the proposed methodology for generating a mixing matrix $C_{gag'a'y}$,
which reflects patterns of age mixing, recurrent mobility between patches, and different contact types,
to the population (14 million) of Ontario, Canada, in the context of \covid transmission modelling.
Ten patches were defined based on groupings of the 513 forward sortation areas (FSAs)%
% SM: for the patches, cite either Brown et al. or the ICES Dashboard
%     depending on which FSA-decile file we used for this example.
%     (will forward email re: the ICES dashboard for the reference on how the FSAs were converted to deciles).
% JK: cited just below -- reading the embedded documentation for that xlsx file (FSA-decile mapping),
%     the dates they give are 15 Jan 2020 - 28 Mar 2021, so I wrote that,
%     but not sure if there is an earlier version we were working from instead?
\footnote{Each FSA is the first 3 characters of the postal code.} in Ontario.
The FSA groupings reflect deciles of cumulative \covid cases,
excluding cases among residents of long-term are homes,
between 15 January 2020 and 28 March 2021 \cite{ICES2020}.
Thus each patch represents approximately 10\% of the Ontario population (\mbox{37--68} FSAs),
but not contiguous geographic regions.
Such definitions were used to support allocation and prioritization of \covid vaccines
to ``hot spot'' neighbourhoods in Ontario \cite{Mishra2021,Brown2021}.
Figure~\ref{fig:map} illustrates the locations of the FSAs and their decile rank,
which is synonymous with their patch index.
Figure~\ref{fig:Yg} plots the daily incidence of \covid cases per patch, and
Figure~\ref{fig:Pga} plots the age distributions of each patch.
Age groups were then defined to reflect historical and hypothetical \covid vaccine eligibility in Ontario:
\begin{equation}
  a_* = \big\{\textsf{0-11, 12-15, 16-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80+}\big\}

\subsection{Data}\label{ex:data}
Ontario population sizes by age and FSA $P_{ga}$ were obtained from
the 2016 Canadian Census via Statistics Canada%
\footnote{\hreftt{https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/98-400-X2016008}}
and aggregated from 1-year age groups ($a_1$) into 5-year ($a_5$) and target ($a_*$) age groups as needed.
We obtained the final output contact matrices $C_{aa'y}$ for Canada from \cite{Prem2021},
for each of the ``home'', ``work'', ``school'', and ``others'' contact types,
as well as the population size of each 5-year age group used in \cite{Prem2021}.%
\footnote{\raggedright
  The rows for Canada in
  \texttt{contacts\_home.rdata},
  \texttt{contacts\_work.rdata},
  \texttt{contacts\_school.rdata}, and
  \texttt{contacts\_others.rdata}
  from \texttt{/generate\_synthetic\_matrices/output/syntheticcontactmatrices2020/} and
  \texttt{poptotal.rdata}
  from \texttt{/generate\_synthetic\_matrices/input/pop/}
  within \hreftt{https://github.com/kieshaprem/synthetic-contact-matrices/tree/6e0eebc}.}
We assumed that residence patch did not influence the numbers of contacts formed per person,
only with whom those contacts are formed,
% MH: Wouldn't variability in population sizes per patch influence contacts per person?
%     I thought we were incorporating variable age distribution?
% JK: Hmm, I meant "per person" to mean "self", rather than "other".
%     So the total number of contacts I form is fixed,
%     but the patterns of with whom they're formed are responsive to the pool.
%     Maybe it was readling like, the number of contacts I formed per *other* person?
%     Does this addition clarify?
although such a belief could be incorporated in the model,
perhaps in Eq.~(\ref{eq:X*.gagay}).
\par
The mobility matrix $B_{gg'}$ between patches was derived using
private data on geolocation service usage among
a sample of approximately 2\% of mobile devices in Ontario \cite{Ghasemi2021}
during January--December 2020.
Appendix~\ref{app.mob} details the specific methods and assumptions used; to summarize:
Each devices was assigned an approximate home location (152.9\,m $\times$ 152.4\,m)
based on the most common location during overnight hours for each calendar month.
This location was then used to determine the home FSA ($n$).
The proportion of time spent outside the home location each day,
stratified by inside vs outside the home FSA,
was also used to estimate the relative proportions of intra- vs inter-FSA mobility.
Finally, the total numbers of visits to other FSAs ($n'$) by all devices were used to estimate
the conditional probability of travelling from FSA $n$ to FSA $n'$,
given that an individual will travel outside the home FSA $n$.
% MH: Might be helpful to add rationale for some of these assumptions
% JK: Good point!
% MH: This is the first we have discussed intra-FSA mobility
%     and we only outline assumptions for unobserved individuals.
%     What about intra-FSA mobility of observed individuals who didn't travel to other FSAs?
%     What about intra-FSA mobility of individuals who did travel to other FSAs?
%     Also, wouldn't most people be mobile within home FSA
%     to run critical errands such as grocery shopping?
%     Does this mean that we are assuming some individuals are not mobile whatsoever?
%     Think more explanation is needed here.
%     NOTE: After reading through manuscript, see we discuss intra-FSA mobility in section A.3.3.
%     Would specifically reference the appendix here.
% JK: Gotcha -- yeah, we do discuss most of this in A.3,
%     which we did mention just above, before "To summarize:"
%     Do you think it's worth repeating again?
%     Also rephrased the details about intra-FSA mobility to better reflect
%     the revised methods.
% JK: [update] largely revised again to reflect
%     most recent updates to methods for computing the mobility matrix.
\par
The contribution of each FSA to overall mobility of the patch/decile (group of FSAs)
was then aggregated as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Bgg}
  B_{gg'} = \sum_{n \in S_g}\sum_{n' \in S_{g'}} B_{nn'}
\end{equation}
where $S_g$ is the set of FSAs ($n$) corresponding to patch/decile $g$.
Mobility matrices were estimated for each month in the available dataset (Jan--Dec 2020).
A reference period reflecting pre-pandemic conditions was defined as Jan--Feb 2020;
unless otherwise specified, all subsequent results use the average mobility patterns during that period
(Figure~\ref{fig:Bgg}).
We did not model any differences in mobility by age group,
although such differences could be included in the model by adding a relative rate in Eq.~(\ref{eq:P*}).

Finally, we specified the proportions of each contact type assumed to be formed with the home pool:
% MH: Why not state proportions that have been set for travel pool if we are stating for the home pool?
% JK: So it should be all others (1-hy) that are formed with the travel pool---
%     I've added a bit of detail in the methods (2.2.2) to clarify. Does that help?
% SM: yes, great point by MH and it helps re the current explanation
% MH: Also may be helpful to add context here in how this connects to individual mobility.
%     e.g. "we specified proprotions of each contact type assumed to be formed with the home pool
%     (i.e. proportions of contact types for "not mobile" individuals).:
% JK: now that the definitions of non-mobile etc. are more clear above,
%     maybe not needed to add more detail here?
\begin{equation}
  h_y = \left\{\textstyle
  \textsf{home}:   1,\enspace
  \textsf{work}:   0,\enspace
  \textsf{school}: 0,\enspace
  \textsf{others}: 0 \right\}
\end{equation}
The parameters $P_{ga}$, $C_{aa'y}$, $B_{gg'}$, and $h_y$ represent
the necessary inputs to our approach for calculating $C_{gag'a'y}$.
The following \S~\ref{ex:results} walks step-wise through the approach
and presents all major intermediate results.

\subsection{Results}\label{ex:results}
% SM: so we made explicit that we did not 'modify' the age-age contacts by contact type beyond Prem et al.
%     which means we still would want to fit to observed data on cases by patches, etc.
% JK: Yes that's right.
% SM: So, just as age-distribution may be different between patches;
%     so might the age-specific contacts by contact time
%     (for example, a patch may have larger  household sizes;
%     a larger subset of the population who work in high-contact occupations, etc.)
%     - so can translate/relate this re: how important the element of patch-context might be.
%     Could bring that up in Conclusion?
% JK: added to the conclusion! (end of para 2)
Figure~\ref{fig:C4AAyi} illustrates the contact matrices $C_{aa'y}$ from \citet{Prem2021},
before and after the steps of unweighting by population age distributions, Eq.~(\ref{eq:C^u}),
and ensuring contact balancing, Eq.~(\ref{eq:C^ub}).
Figure~\ref{fig:C4AAyd} illustrates the differences in contact matrices between each step.
These differences can be explained as follows.
The Canadian age distribution used by \citet{Prem2021} (Figure~\ref{fig:Pga}, black dashed line),
is below the mean for the youngest and oldest age groups;
thus inverting the weighting by this age distribution
increases the contacts expected with these age groups (Figure~\ref{fig:C4AAyd01}).
By contrast, Figure~\ref{fig:C4AAyd12} is purely symmetric (and opposite about the central diagonal),
reflecting differences from the symmetric mean matrix.
\par
Figure~\ref{fig:C4**y} illustrates the unweighted and balanced contact matrices $C^{ub}_{aa'y}$
before and after bilinear interpolation and aggregation to the target age groups of interest, Eq.~(\ref{eq:Ca*}).
The final matrices $C^{ub}_{a_*a'_*y}$ include dominant horizontal streaks corresponding to larger age groups.
These streaks are expected, as more contacts are expected to form with larger ``other'' age groups.
Vertical streaks do not appear, as each column represents
the expected contacts for each person in the ``self'' age group,
not the total contacts formed by that age group.%
\footnote{The corresponding matrix of absolute contact $X_{aa'y} = C_{aa'y} P_{a'}$
  will be symmetric, and thus will include symmetric horizontal and vertical streaks.}

Finally, Figure~\ref{fig:CX4y} illustrates the margins
(sum over ``other'' strata and population-weighted average over ``self'' strata)
of the complete mixing matrices $C_{gag'a'y}$, in terms of
age groups $a$~\&~$a'$ (Figure~\ref{fig:CX4aay}), and
patches/deciles $g$~\&~$g'$ (Figure~\ref{fig:CX4ggy}).
Such margins are computed as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Caay}
  C_{aa'y} = \left.\sum_{g} P_{ga} \sum_{g'} C_{gag'a'y} \middle/ \sum_{g} P_{ga} \right.
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Cggy}
  C_{gg'y} = \left.\sum_{a} P_{ga} \sum_{a'} C_{gag'a'y} \middle/ \sum_{a} P_{ga} \right.
\end{equation}
The equivalent matrices for total number of contacts per person of all types
($C_{aa'}$ and $C_{gg'}$) are also given in Figures~\ref{fig:CXaay}~and~\ref{fig:CXggy}, respectively.
The marginal matrices $C_{aa'y}$ are identical to the input age mixing matrices from Eq.~(\ref{eq:Ca*}),
which could be used as an implementation check.
Since $h_y = 1$ for ``home'' contacts, $C_{gg'y}$ is an identity matrix.
The equivalent matrices for ``work'', ``school'', and ``others'' contact types
also feature a strong diagonal, due to a strong diagonal in the source mobility matrix $B_{gg'}$
(individuals who are mobile within their home FSA).
However, the off-diagonal elements are less clustered towards the central diagonal
versus the mobility matrix $B_{gg'}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:Bgg}).
Mobile individuals from patches $g$ and $g'$ may form contacts
not only when either travels to the others' patch,
but also when they both travel to a third patch.
Thus, the degree of mixing between patches using this approach
% SM: this sentence/statement is a really importnat message/point - can we include in abstract?
% JK: done!
is greater than the mobility matrix alone would suggest,
though less than if completely random mixing was assumed.
